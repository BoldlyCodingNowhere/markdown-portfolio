## What to say first?

***What*** to say first? or  What to say ***first***?

By saying it, am I telling the world this is the first and foremost thing about me?  That’s quite a pressure. ⛰️

> *“My name is Inago Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die!”* :crossed_swords: - The Princess Bride

Pithy and revengeful. That’s a great description because it’s his raison-d’etre. That’s all you need to know because you’ll be dead shortly. 

But not suitable or helpful here. Although my anxiety at trying to describe myself makes me want to say:

> *“My name is Andrew Hayler. You killed my describing faculties. Prepare for lies!”* :cold_sweat:

But lies are a kettle of problems in themselves. Like trying to remember and maintain the mask of them - which I should be good at as I’m an actor! However, that’s much easier when someone else has written the words for you and defined your ‘role.’  Trying to keep the delicate threads of the web together also does nothing for your mindfulness and inner calm! :lotus_position_man:

Sorry to waffle at you. You are a good listener, you know...and...*actually*, I think you have helped me to describe myself. No, ***really***.

I’ve mentioned I am an **Actor** :performing_arts: and therefore the **performative skills** that comes with. I’m a good **communicator** :speaking_head: - both written and verbal - demonstrated as you are still here (*I hope*) and I love to see people smile and be happy (*hopefully your face is doing that!*) by being **approachable**, **inclusive** and having a good **sense of humour**. I’m **hard-working** and **self-motivated** (*have taken the time to rethink this from a different angle! - so a **problem-solver** as well*) and talking with you has helped the creation of this so I’m also a great **team-player** (*a key tool for being an actor as well!*)

Thank you for your help! I’m ready to describe myself now.
